# MÃ‰LANGE ðŸŽ¨

A game where players pitted against each other with a randomized pallette and a canvas to create a color that is the closest match to a randomized goal color.

## To run
- Download and install repo `yarn install`
- Run the app `yarn start` 

## Technologies (so far just the front end)
- TypeScript
- React
- Zustand
## Interesting problems
- Randomly generating colors that go well together.
- Randomly generating a goal color that is reachable by a combination of the pallette.
- Websocket protocol for multiplayer.
